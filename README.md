# Rental Project Analysis

This repository contains code and data for analyzing rental unit information in the Greater Montreal Area, obtained from Kijiji. The project aims to provide insights into rental prices, factors influencing them, and a deep dive into rental units in the Longueuil neighborhood.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to conduct a comprehensive analysis of rental unit data to address key questions such as:

- What are the rental prices in different areas of the Greater Montreal Area?
- What factors influence rental prices the most?
- How does rental unit data in the Longueuil neighborhood compare to the overall dataset?

## Data Collection

The data for this analysis was scraped from [Kijiji](https://www.kijiji.ca/b-appartement-condo/ouest-de-lile-qc/c37l1700280?address=752%204e%20Avenue%2C%20Verdun%2C%20QC%20H4G%202Y4%2C%20Canada&ll=45.456978%2C-73.57419&radius=2.0), focusing on rental unit listings in the Greater Montreal Area. The data includes information such as rental prices, location, amenities, and more.

## Data Cleaning

Significant data cleaning was performed to ensure accurate address location information and eliminate inconsistencies in the dataset.

## Analysis Techniques

The analysis will utilize regression analysis to understand the factors influencing rental prices. Additionally, a deep dive will be conducted specifically on rental units in the Longueuil neighborhood to gain insights into this particular area.
